## General Information
- Clients Horiseon requested an improvement in accessibility in the page's HTML, optimizing SEO representation and user acessibility. 
- This project replaced the non-descriptive <div> elements and replaced with semantic HTML to assist with browser accessibility and further organizing the HTML for future developers. 
- The refactored code is now more efficiently labeled, using descriptive semantics and developer comments throughout the code. All images appeared to be non-essential decorative images, so they were given empty alt tags to assist the screenreader's efficiency as well. The CSS stylesheet has been re-arranged and re-titled, and the website's sections are now all consistent with the layout of the webpage, complete with comments indicating the functions of each section.
